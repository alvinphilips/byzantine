Additionally, this can be used to serialize content provided in a different format, e.g. JSON object `{\"user\": \"alice\", \"message\": \"Message\"}` can be serialized by JS code into Borsh format such that it can be deserialized into `struct UserMessage {user: String, message: String}` on Rust side."],["schema_helpers",""],["ser",""]]};
