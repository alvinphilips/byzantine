# byzantine
A voting platform that ___doesn't make sense___.

### Read the documentation here
[byzantine docs](https://polarvoid.github.io/byzantine/byzantine/)

## Inspiration
We picked the name **Byzantine** because of the [Byzantine Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault), and thought it fit well for what we were going for

## What it does
Byzantine works by holding **rounds**, and you vote for one of the two abstract choices presented to you. There is no right answer, the only thing that matters is if you are in the majority. The losers' tokens are distributed among the winners.

## How we built it
- We used the [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) framework and Rust to write our on-chain Solana programs, and our front-end code is written in Next.js and React

## Challenges we ran into
- Managing our time well
- Figuring out 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Ayush made some really cool whiteboard art
- Alvin wrote a few simple Solana programs

## What we learned
- How Solana programs work
- The [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) framework

## What's next for Byzantine
- We'd love to finish working on our project, and add some cool new features like minting NFTs, and adding some more fun minigames
